## Installation

This list is designed for installation via [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/). However, due to current file hosting limitations, a few required mods need to be downloaded manually. After downloading, place these files into your Wabbajack `downloads` folder.

### Required Manual Downloads

Please download and place the following files in your Wabbajack `downloads` folder before installation:

- [Vanilla UI Extension 1.0](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-extension/downloads/vanilla-ui-extension-10)  
- [Vanilla UI Plus – NV (Mirror 1)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-plus/downloads/vanilla-ui-plus-nv)  
- [Vanilla UI Plus – NV (Mirror 2)](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vanilla-ui-plus/downloads/vanilla-ui-plus-nv)

## Optional Tools and Enhancements

### BSA Decompressor

Included in the tools folder is a BSA decompressor (credit to the original creator). This utility can be used to recompress the game’s archive files into a format better optimized for performance. Use it if you experience stuttering or long load times.

### New Vegas Reloaded (NVR)

This modlist supports New Vegas Reloaded, and presets are included. To install:

1. Join the [Elder Scrolls Reloaded Discord](https://discord.gg/7w7X5Y5).
2. Download the most recent New Vegas-compatible build.
3. Install it manually as instructed in their documentation.

The list functions with or without NVR, but was built with it in mind.

### Troubleshooting Installation Script

If the `InstalScript.vd` file fails to run or throws an error, open the file in a text editor and ensure that the line beginning with `run process` is entirely lowercase. Capitalizing `Run Process` will cause the script to fail during Wabbajack installation.
## Known Issues and Notes

This is a very early build of *A Blue Moon*, so bugs are expected. Any help in identifying issues is appreciated.

If you encounter any serious bugs or crashes, please report them so I can patch them quickly.

## Feedback and Support

*A Blue Moon* is a personal project and still under active development. I'm open to suggestions, bug reports, and general feedback. You can open an issue here or reach out directly.

Also note: This is my **first ever modding project**. I’m still learning as I go, and this has been a huge step out of my comfort zone. Thanks for your patience and support.

## Special Thanks

- Huge thanks to **macintroll** for allowing the use of his incredible high-resolution retextures for both **Securitrons** and **Ghouls**.  
- Huge thanks to **Rage** for all the effort, time, and patience in teaching me and hand-holding me through all my dumb questions.  
  Like seriously, Rage — thank you for encouraging me to begin this project and helping me each step of the way. Without your help, it would've never made it this far.  
- Thanks to **Salamand3r** for putting together the wonderfully broken NVR setup for me — it wouldn’t be the same without it.  
- Credit to the authors of LoneStar, Vicious Wastes, Vanilla UI Plus, and all the mods used in this list.  
- Thanks to the Wabbajack team and the larger FNV modding community for making a project like this possible.

## Final Thoughts

*A Blue Moon* is meant to breathe new life into Fallout: New Vegas without losing its soul. It's not perfect yet—but with your feedback and patience, it will get there.

Thanks for playing.

## Additional Notes

- **DXVK Compatibility:** This list includes **DXVK** in the `StockGame` folder to help resolve **alt-tabbing issues**. If this causes problems on your system (such as crashes or rendering glitches), simply delete `d3d9.dll` and `dxvk.conf` from that folder to disable it.

- **New Vegas Reloaded (NVR):** The list currently ships with **NVR additions enabled by default**. If you're not using New Vegas Reloaded, **disable those mods** in MO2. This will be fixed in the next compilation.

- **Gameplay State:** The gameplay portion of the list is still **very much a work in progress**. What's included now is a **barebones setup** for balance and mechanics. It's intended to serve as a framework for the full experience. Your feedback on how it *feels* is incredibly valuable—this is nowhere near final, and nothing is set in stone yet.

- **Alternate Hardcore Profiles:** A few **alternate, hardcore-focused profiles** are included in **MO2** for players interested in testing different styles of gameplay. These should be fully patched and functional, but keep in mind: **they haven't been thoroughly playtested yet**. Feel free to explore them and let me know what works and what doesn't.
